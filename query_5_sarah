SELECT t.t_id, t.cert_id, e.e_id
FROM travels_on as trav, trains AS t, operating_comp AS c, employee AS e, conductor as conduct
WHERE (trav.proj_start < trav.act_start OR trav.proj_end < trav.act_start) AND

      c.c_id = e.c_id AND
      e.e_id = conduct.e_id AND
      t.cert_id <= conduct.cert_id AND
      c.c_id = "4";
